# This is a program that uses letter frequency in order to determine the shift code of a cipher. This is a pretty basic program that has no error detection. 
# Error handlng could easily be implemented, however, this was not needed for the specifications I set. This is more a proof of concept for myself and what I was learning in a University unit.

# This program uses linked lists to save the frequency of letters, as this decreases search time for finding the most commong letter. 
# The program also uses an ArrayList in order to check if the words that are decrypted are actually in the English language.
# A dictionary of words.txt is created to check that the found key is correct.
